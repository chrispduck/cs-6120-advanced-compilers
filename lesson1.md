# Lesson 1 
## Welcome and Overview

Role of a compiler:
* Checks for syntax, type, semantic errors
* Translates code into machine code
* Optimizes code
* Generates executable

Proebsting's law - compiler performance doubles every 18 years.
Follows an exponentional curve, but much slower than Moore's law.

Compiler optimisations isnt just about optimising C. There are more and more languagess, hardware targets (GPU), and domain specific languages (e.g. Tensorflow).

N^2 scaling (n hardwares * n languages )

Specialised hardware is not great if you need to write machine code for each.
